If we are not working on the CS293 machine,
1. Download the Teach-me-CS213.tar.gz folder from moodle.
2. Copy this tar folder to the CS293 machine using scp Teach-me-CS213.tar.gz yourlogin@10.105.2.101:
3.Now ssh to the cs293 machine:
ssh -X yourlogin@10.105.2.101

Then start from the 3rd point given below to compile and run the project

Assuming we are working on the CS293 Machine.
To start the project, the following steps are to be undertaken:
1. Download the Teach-me-CS213.tar.gz folder from moodle.
Then on the Terminal,
2. Untar it using tar -zxvf *.tar.gz
3. Change directory to go into the Newly created Teach-me-CS213 by using cd Teach-me-CS213
4. Remove all the .o files (if any)  using rm *.o
5. Remove all the moc_*.cpp files(if any) by using rm moc_*
6. As it is a Qt project compile it using qmake
7. Then run make ( everything should be okay except a few warnings about comparision between signed int and unsigned int)
8. An executable by the name cs213 will be made. call it by giving the command ./cs213
9. the program will start and continue playing with the ADT implementations provided

ALternatively after step 5,
6. call qtcreator by giving the command qtcreator
7. the Qt IDE will start and from the menu select "open project"
8. browse and select cs213.pro file from the Teach-me-CS213 folder
9. Build it and run it
