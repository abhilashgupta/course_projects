Instructions for executing the file

The way I worked was I extracted the jar files provided to us in the same folder as where JDBCSample.java is.
this is to make it work. JDBCSample.java is my sourcecode file
I am attaching the folders that are made after extraction of the JAR file.
after that I need to have the four csv files which I have attached along. 
They are to be in the same folder as the source code.

The compilation is as follows:
javac JDBCSample.java
java JDBCSample

Part 3.
It asks for the parametrised query(PrepareStatement) that you wish to  execute.

According to the query it displays the answer.

N.B. - all the above instructions occur serially in a single execution.
Once executed, we have to do each step one by one till the end
